# Android app created during Hack Western 2 (November 2015)

Yes, Mom! is an Android app created by myself, along with a team of 3 of my friends during Hack Western 2.

The idea behind the app is to create job listings to easily connect people who need everyday chores done with people who are capable of doing them. This makes it easier for people to do work in their spare time for some extra cash as this app allows them to create a work schedule as flexible as they choose it to be.

I have added the Parse server-side code in the "ParseServer" directory.
